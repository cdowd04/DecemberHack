General Description: The High Technology Meet Tracker will open up all 5 google meet links of the 5 classes you have that day, each one minute before the period starts. This program will conveniently ensure that you will never be late for any class again.

Justification: We believe that our project deserves a good score as it is very fitting to the theme of the December-January hack challenge. Utilizing a user-friendly system our program easily automates the virtual school schedule by automatically opening up the users google meet links at the correct time of class. Although seemingly rudimentary on the surface, our work is very polished and very user friendly. As we have never had this software before we think it can really help lazy students that don't feel like opening their meet links.
